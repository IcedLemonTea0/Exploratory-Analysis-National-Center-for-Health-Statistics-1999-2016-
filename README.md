# Basic Analysis: Leading Causes of Death in United States (1999-2016)
###### *Author: Amir Gharti Magar*

## Brief Intro about the Author
I am a recent college graduate with a degree in B.S Applied Mathematics currently pursuing Data Analytics as a career path. I am working towards the realm of Data Science with the help of my background and, my desire to learn high level statistics and strengthening my technical skills.

Still new to the industry, I have self-taught Python and have intermediate understanding of data visualization tools such as: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Currently I am learning machine learning algorithms to make predictions on certain amount of datasets - create exploratory analysis and building predictive model to solve problems. 

As my first project, I specifically chose this project to primarily test my technical (visualization) ability but more importantly to harness critical thinking in a data analytical way and discover real life problems to convey deeper meaning behind datas.  

I appreciate your time to look over my work and gladly welcome any constructive criticism. 
	
## **Goals:**
	* Retrieve datas from NCHS website, create dataframe
	* Use Pandas (Python Library) to organize,label, and clean irrelevant datas
	* Formulate questions and explain the methodology to solve the problems  
	* Build 2 simple data visualization to convey the relationships of your work
	* Summarize briefly but more importantly reach meaningful conclusions to your findings
<br> 

## **Methodology**:
This report will be analyzed using Python. It includes multiple data analytics visualization libraries.

<br> 
I will primarily be using:

	* Pandas --> Data Manupilation
	* Matplotlib --> Simple data visualization 
	* Numpy 
	* Seaborn --> Better version of Matplotlib
 
In this analysis I will present the findings using **data visualitions** followed by **thorough explanation** after each section. 
Furthermore, I will briefly explain the codes - as need be - to simplify and avoid any confusions for the readers.  

## **Datasets**
The main datasets for this analysis report are from **NCHS's** (National Center for Health Statistics).

Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia using demographic and medical characteristics. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates after 2010 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.
